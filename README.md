# ECE-310: Digital-Signal-Processing
Problem sets for ECE-310: Digital Signal Processing

## Project Descriptions
- **Problem Set 1:** Corrupted sine wave is sent through a Chebychev filter. Resulting magnitude spectrum and zero-pole plot are displayed.

- **Problem Set 2:** Spectral factorization of discrete-time WSS random signal

- **Problem Set 3:** Chebychev, butterworth, and elliptic filters are constructed and tested with a random signal. Magnitude and phase responses are plotted.

- **Problem Set 4:** All-pass quantization is performed to various levels, and the resulting zero-pole plots are compared.

- **Problem Set 5:** McClellan Transform for multidimensional FIR filters.

- **Problem Set 6:** Converts a symbolic 2D Z-Transform into an impulse response matrix, and displays it.

- **Problem Set 7:** Upscaling and downscaling with low-pass filters.
